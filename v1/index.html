  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="image-container">
    <p><strong>Hello, I'm George</strong>, a 17-year-old computer science student who is aspiring to pursue a career in the industry and further my studies in Computer Science and AI at university. Below is a showcase of my competencies and achievements, and I am hoping to inspire you to consider me for work experience. Gaining valuable work experience like this is crucial for me as it will allow me to demonstrate my abilities on personal statements and CVs.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>


        <h3><a href="https://www.gebmusic.com">GebMusic.com</a></h3>
        <p>This is a website I wrote to help me organise my gigs and music. (This page is on that site's URL since it is the only URL I currently own)</p>


        <h3>Terminal Arcade</h3>
        <p>I wrote an entire arcade exclusively run in terminal. The code was written in Python and had complete working versions of Snake, Pong, Atari Breakout and Tetris.</p>


        <h3>Discord Bots</h3>
        <p>I've made many Discord Bots in Python and Java for chat moderation, offensive language scanning, and announcement formatting. I also created a bot for a real-time online game called Cards Against Humanities, but had to abandon it due to library issues.</p>

  <!-- LANGUAGES -->
  <section id="languages">
    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <p><strong>Python: </strong>Highly competent with Python (Using APIs, managing complex data structures, web scraping, OOP)</p>

    <p><strong>HTML: </strong>Reasonable competency with HTML, having written websites such as this one purely from scratch</p>

    <p><strong>CSS: </strong>Reasonable competency with CSS, after studying it from books and then applying it in several projects, such as the <a href="https://www.gebmusic.com">GebMusic.com</a> website</p>

    <p><strong>JavaScript: </strong>Fairly competent at JavaScript, having used it several times before in a variety of projects. However, I am yet to create a JavaScript centred project</p>
      
    <p><strong>Web-Development: </strong>Written several websites from scratch from scratch, such as <a href="https://www.gebmusic.com">GebMusic.com</a>, which serves as a hub for my music. This website includes complex HTML, CSS and a basic use of JavaScript in order to run API calls and put logic behind buttons on the site.</p>
      
    <p><strong>Unity: </strong>Basic understanding of Unity, but have never done any proper projects in it other than creating a terrain generator for fun</p>
      
    <p><strong>Java and C#: </strong>Reasonably competent with Java and C#, having written mods for video games and using C# for the unity project I mentioned</p>
      
    <p><strong>Swift: </strong>Basic understanding of Swift, but have not created any finished projects, just bits and pieces to experiment with</p>
      
    <p>This is all to say that I am a very fast learner with whatever task I am given. Before writing the website, my knowledge of HTML was extremely limited, and within a week I had developed a deep understanding of the language and created the website you will see now. I can cope with large quantities of work effectively and always deliver a high quality result
